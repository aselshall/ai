## 4. FAQ 

The instructor will regularly update this section throughout the project to answer common questions and clarify any uncertainties that students may have. Make sure to check this section before submitting your project deliverables. 

### 1. Are there any project themes or topics that we are restricted to? 

While there is no strict limitation on project themes, your chosen topic should fall under the broader umbrella of water and environmental data science. This includes, but is not limited to, areas such as environmental science, ecological studies, hydrology, environmental engineering, climate change impacts, environmental economics, urban planning, demographic changes, public health concerns, social media discourse, and social sciences research, all with a focus on water, climate, or environmental issues. Your project should demonstrate the application of Python for data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving in these interconnected fields.

### 2. In case I do not have a project idea, how can I find one?   

The key is to choose a project that aligns with your interests and allows you to demonstrate your skills in Python and water and environmental data analysis. To get project ideas you can:
- **Your current work**: Leverage on a project that you currently doing at work, working on with your supervisor, or for your graduation
- **Explore datasets**: Explore available datasets from various sources such as [Data.Gov](https://data.gov), [NOAA](https://data.noaa.gov/onestop/), [NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/browse), [copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/accessing-data-where-and-how/copernicus-services-catalogue), [USGS](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/), Tax data [SOI Tax Stats - Data by Geographic Area](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-data-by-geographic-area), and Kaggle Open Datasets and Machine Learning Projects [Kaggle csv data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv) to generate creative project ideas.
- **Research papers**: Explore research papers from an [environmental data science journal](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science) or a [special issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/22582/rapid-reproducible-and-robust-environmental-modeling-for-decision-support-worked-examples-and-open-source-software-tools/articles)
- **Build on existing projects**: Leverage on an existing project such the as environmental projects on [Environmental Data Driven Inquiry and Exploration (Eddie)](https://serc.carleton.edu/eddie), tutorials from [NASA Gesdisc](https://github.com/nasa/gesdisc-tutorials), or [cookbooks from Project Pythia](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org/)
- **Local concerns**: Identify an environmental problem specific to your local area that aligns with your interests or reach out to local environmental organizations or agencies. For example, contact the [Director of Community Engagement at FGCU Service-Learning team](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/servicelearning/aboutus#OurTeam) and he will pair you with a local organization that suits your interest, and you can count service learnig hours.
- **Seek Guidance**: Consult with your instructor, who may have suggestions for tailored project ideas that suit your interests and learning goals.


### 3. For the project summary, what do you mean by "plan for implementation" ?

I recommend focusing on a question or hypothesis that does not require extensive data collection or complex modeling, which can be time-consuming. Given the number of hours that you will spend on this project per week, you need to have a realistic plan to complete your project on time. Once you decide on your research/management/business question or hypothesis, you can outline a plan for implementation. Here is an exampe. 

>- **Week 1:** Project planning and data source identification. Define the scope and goals clearly, and start searching for and gathering required data.
>- **Week 2:** Data acquisition and initial exploration. Download the needed datasets and conduct preliminary analysis to understand the data.
>- **Week 3:** Data cleaning and preparation. Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.
>- **Week 4:** In-depth data analysis. Use statistical methods or machine learning models if applicable to test your hypothesis or answer your research question.
>- **Week 5:** Interpretation of results and report drafting. Begin to draw conclusions from your analysis and start writing your findings.
>- **Week 6:** Finalizing the report/presentation. Refine your report, and prepare the presentation and final report to share your project results.

Remember to allocate some time for unexpected challenges and iterative improvement. 
    
### 4. Will I lose points for incomplete documentation of code?

Yes. Incomplete documentation of the code will result in a deduction of marks, particularly if markdown cells are not utilized for annotations. In this course, you are not only learning good coding skills but also good coding practices (GCP). Markdown cell annotations improves readability and understanding for both users and your future reference. By providing narrative descriptions alongside the code, it becomes easier to understand code functionality and purpose, facilitating understanding and future modifications.

For example, please review your lessons and homework solutions, where I use markdown cells to provide narrative context. This transforms the notebook into not just code, but a story to tell. Has not this enhanced your learning experience?

This is another example from real life for [a report](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.786223/full) with accompanying [annotated code](https://github.com/aselshall/feart/blob/main/Subset_selection/SubsetSelection.ipynb). While you do not need to replicate this level of detail for your project, it serves as a real-life example.
   
For further guidance, refer to 'GCP 2 - Describing your code' in the 'Good Coding Practice (GCP)' module on Canvas. Additionally, ensure adherence with the [final report rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/eds/HW/project#24-final-report-rubric-50).
   
### 5. Where should I upload the code and do I need to use GitHub?
  
Using GitHub or a similar platform is required for a higher grade. Refer to the Data Availability criterion in the [final report rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/eds/HW/project#24-final-report-rubric-50) for specific requirements. This aligns with data communication and best coding practices outlined in your [project objectives](https://aselshall.github.io/eds/HW/project#12-project-objectives). Adherence to these practices contributes to a better grade according to the [final report rubric](https://aselshall.github.io/eds/HW/project#24-final-report-rubric-50).
  
To upload your code and data to GitHub, follow these steps:  
1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository.
3. Cite your code repository in your report.  
4. Upload your data and code to your GitHub repository.  
6. Upload your presentation and report to your GitHub repository.

Additionally, with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), you can open your notebooks in an executable environment, making your code promptly reproducible by anyone without the need to install Python or Jupyter. 

If all your data and code are on GitHub and cited in your report, you only need to submit your report to Canvas. If you did not share your code on GitHub, you must submit both the report and code on Canvas.

If you prefer not to share your data on GitHub, you can still share your code or part of it to demonstrate your use of GitHub. In this case, upload your data and code to Canvas.  

Whether you uploaded your code on Canvas or GitHub, for grading purposes, ensure that your code is fully functional.
