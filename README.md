## Catalog Description
Foundations, applications, and responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in engineering practice and research.    
           
*Prerequisites:* Introductory programming, statstics and calculus, or consent of the instructor.

## Introduction 
This course introduces engineering students to the foundations, applications, and responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in engineering practice and research, emphasizing ethical awareness, reproducible workflows, and data-driven problem solving. Through hands-on  exercises and real-world case studies, students develop practical skills in coding, machine learning, and generative AI tools. Emphasis is placed on how AI can support data-driven analysis, modeling, and innovation across engineering domains. 
    
This course is designed for students in civil and envionmental engineering and construction management with consideration that some students may not have a strong programming background. We will begin by building programming literacy through AI coding assistants. For demonstrations we will be use Python, which is a versatile and widely used programming language. We will then explore core machine learning paradigms including supervised and unsupervised learning, before advancing to deep learning and generative AI applications. The course concludes with an independent study module, where students explore AI tools or applications relevant to their engineering domain and present their findings to the class. Ethical and professional considerations of AI use are integrated throughout the course.

The course implements several pedagogical innovations through the FACT-3A framework ([Elshall and Badir, 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2025.1596462) and [Elshall et al., In-Review](https://mewcha1.github.io/NBI/_downloads/b636f28d80b671fff3839901bc0cc99e/Elshall_et_al_2025_AI.pdf)), which integrates **F**undamental skills, **A**pplied projects, **C**onceptual understanding, and critical **T**hinking (FACT) assesssment with **AI** **A**ffordance **A**lignment (A3). Through deliberately aligning learning objectives with AI capabilities, this framework balances traditional assessment of foundational knowledge with the open use of AI for real-world project learning. The framework includes the following pedagogical innovations:
1. **Instructor–learner co-design** where students collaborate with the instructor to co-create course policies, AI-use guidelines, and evaluation rubrics, ensuring transparency and shared ownership of learning.
2. **Scaffolded AI use** with a mix of no-AI use, AI-resistant assignments, structured-AI use, and open-AI use on complex projects builds foundational understanding and skills to effectively and efficiently leverage AI assistance.
3. **Dynamic syllabus** where The course incorporates elective modules, independent study, and self-directed learning assignments to cultivate the adaptive skills required for lifelong learning.
4. **Redefined roles** where the instructor acts as a mentor for higher-order reasoning, AI serves as a tutor for routine tasks, and the student becomes a lifelong learner, fostering a collaborative human-AI learning environment.
5. **Hybrid assessment design (FACT Framework)** that balances no-AI exam that measures foundational knowledge with AI-assisted projects that assess applied skills, providing a comprehensive view of student learning.

This student-centered framework is designed to equip you not only with technical skills but also with the critical, self-regulated mindset required to lead and innovate responsibly in a future defined by human-AI collaboration.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion, students will be able to:
1. Explain key AI concepts and their applications in engineering
2. Use a programming language and AI tools to analyze big data
3. Apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for predictive modeling
4. Employ generative AI to access and build upon specialized knowledge with critical oversight
5. Identify and evaluate ethical and professional considerations of AI
6. Share data and findings using notebooks and Git for reproducible workflow

Few assignments are designed to include self-directed learning opportunities. This is to give you the opportunity to explore and experiment with engineering problems of your interest.

### Late Homework Policy

- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day of the total possible points
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

## Exam

- A final comprehensive exam will be in-person, conducted with pencil and paper in FE exam format.
- The exam will cover mandatory modules (Modules 1 to 7).
- The exam is one hour and consists of about 60 multiple-choice questions.
- The exam is open-book but no internet access is allowed.
- Only FE-approved calculators are permitted. That is a regular calculator and not a smart calculator or smart phone that is connected to the internet. Laptops are allowed as long as there is no internet access. Any form of internet access is prohibited.
- Study guide: If you can solve the exercises, practice problems, and homework, you will be prepared for the exam.
- Receiving or providing unauthorized assistance, including using the internet, will result in a grade of zero on this exam. The [academic dishonesty policy](https://aselshall.github.io/aea/#policy-for-academic-integrity-violations) will apply.
- A makeup exam may be provided for students with an [execused absence](#Execused-Absence-Policy)

## Execused Absence Policy

- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
