## Catalog Description
Introduction to the foundations, applications, and ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI) in engineering practice and research.

## Prerequisites
Introductory programming or consent of the instructor.

## Introduction 
This course introduces engineering students to the foundations, applications, and ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI) in engineering practice and research. Through hands-on  exercises, real-world case studies, and project-based learning, students develop practical skills in Python programming, machine learning, and generative AI tools. Emphasis is placed on how AI can support data-driven decision-making, modeling, and innovation across engineering domains.

We will begin by building Python literacy through AI coding assistants. We will then explore core machine learning paradigms— supervised and unsupervised learning — before advancing to deep learning and generative AI applications. The course concludes with an independent study module, where students explore an AI tool or application relevant to their engineering domain and present their findings to the class. Ethical and professional considerations of AI use are integrated throughout the course.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion, students will be able to:
- Explain key AI concepts and their applications in engineering
- Use Python and AI tools to analyze big data
- Apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques
- Evaluate and interpret AI results critically
- Describe ethical and professional considerations of AI
- Share AI projects using Jupyter notebooks and GitHub for reproducible workflow

| B | 83% to 86.99% | C- | 70% to 72.99% |

### Assessment plan (100%)
- Participation 10%
- Homework 60%
- Final Exam 30%

General notes
- If you are falling behind, consult the [academic calendar](https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/academiccalendar/) for the last day to drop.
- Incomplete grades are granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergency)

## Participation
For participation assessment, students are expected to:
- Watch recorded videos and fill-out exit tickets and participation activities
- Complete the survey at the end of each module meaningfully to provide instructor with constructive feedback and suggestions

These form the majority of your participation grade.  

## Homework
A weekly homework will be posted on Canvas. Each assignment is due by Sunday at 11:59 pm, unless otherwise posted on CANVAS. Few assignments are designed to include self-directed learning opportunities. This is to give you the opportunity to explore and experiment with engineering problems of your interest.

### Late Homework Policy
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day of the total possible points
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

## Exam
- A final comprehensive exam will be in-person, conducted with pencil and paper in FE exam format.
- The exam will only cover mandatory modules (Modules 1 to 6) and elective moudles are not included.
- The exam is two hours and consists of about 20 multiple-choice and true or false questions.
- The exam is open-book but no internet access is allowed.
- Only FE-approved calculators are permitted. That is a regular calculator and not a smart calculator or smart phone that is connected to the internet. Laptops are allowed as long as there is no internet access. Any form of internet access is prohibited.
- Study guide: If you can solve the exercises, practice problems, and homework, you will be prepared for the exam.
- Exam review will be posted on Canvas after the week of the last mandatory module.
- Receiving or providing unauthorized assistance, including using the internet, will result in a grade of zero on this exam. The [academic dishonesty policy](https://aselshall.github.io/aea/#policy-for-academic-integrity-violations) will apply.
- A makeup exam may be provided for students with an [execused absence](#Execused-Absence-Policy)

## Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

## Program Learning Outcomes  
The learning outcomes for the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) Program are as follows: [Link](https://aselshall.github.io/rm/admin/outcome)

## Policy for Academic Integrity Violations 
- Academic dishonesty in assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission, and will be strictly addressed in line with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf).
- Familiarize yourself with the [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/) that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations.

## Financial Aid Statement

As of fall 2015, all faculty members are required to use Canvas to confirm a student's attendance for each course by the end of the first week of classes. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. The confirmation of attendance is required for all students, not only those receiving financial aid.

## Generative AI Use

Generative AI including large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gimini, or Claude can be used for studying, but must not be used in assignments and exams unless indicated by the text "Generative AI Permitted". Students must cite the used generative AI tool, and failing to do so will be considered academic dishonesty. Check [FGCU generative AI policy](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/generative-ai) for more details.

## Core Syllabus Policies 

FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU. Be sure to review these [online](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/core-syllabus-policy-statements)
